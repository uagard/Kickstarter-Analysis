# Kickstarter-Analysis
Performing analysis on Kickstarter data to discover trends

# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
The overview of this project is to utilize certain analysis techniques in order to define if there are trends located within the data that was provided.
### Purpose
A particular play is being observed, it was determined that it narrowly missed reaching its fundraising goal. This goal was set created was unfortunaley not reached in its short amount of time. Now, we wants to know how different campaigns compared to their launch dates and their funding goals. We are given a dataset in a file named Kickstarter. We are going to create data visualizations of the campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. 
## Analysis and Challenges
We utilized the information from the year and parent category. Next we used the outcomes column and placed a count paramter on it in order to determine the number of items that were successful, failed, or canceled. Once I have all of the data I can take the data and display then on a line chart and label it theater outcomes based on the launch date.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In order to gain the knowledge that is needed to make a proper assessment. I needed to determine what weer the outcomes of the theater projects. There were several perameters that was used to determine this information. After looking at the data it was concluded that this data was best preseented in a pivot table. The pivot table will help compile all of the data into a table that we can break down into various categories. In order to find out the outcomes we took information from certain columns.
### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
The next evaluation that is needed to be done is on the outcomes based on the different goals. This chart will break down the goal section into different categories. The categories will be seperated in order to determine the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays. In this evaluation I had to use the countifs formula to pull the number of goals that were successful within each parameter. Once that was done, the total number of projects had to be calculated. This information allowed the percentage to be calculated for each category. This inforamation was created by dividing the number of successful column by the total projects. Once this was done I was able to create a line chart with the percentage and the goals.
### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
During this project the main difficulty encounter was figuring out the proper way to write the countifs formulas. It took a few tries to figure out how to write the formulas in order to bring back the correct value within the parameters given.
## Results
- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
#According to the data it looks like during the year the most successful campaigns were during the months of May and June. There really was not anything in particular that coorelated to when campaigns failed or were canceled.
- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
I would conclude that if you had a goal anywhere frm=om $4999 and below you would be successful in reaching your goal.
- What are some limitations of this dataset?
The amount of the goal
- What are some other possible tables and/or graphs that we could create?
We could possibly use a bar, and scatter.
